## Section 1: Requirements
- The Week View is displayed horizontally starting with Sunday.
- Event and Task Creation can be done from the menu bar on the top left of the screen. When a new widget creation
is selected, the user is prompted to enter in specifics of the task/event like its title, description, and duration.
- Commitment Warnings are displayed when the user tries to add an event or task that will exceed their set maximum
task and event creation for the week
- Persistence has been implemented by letting the user start a new week and this will output and new Bujo file with
their week's created tasks/events, or open an existing Bujo file and resume their journaling.

## Section 2: Headlining Features
- Task Queue can be seen on the left side of the journal where the user can view all their tasks for the whole week. 
So, as soon as the user creates a new task/event it will be visible on the calendar view of the week as well as the 
task bar.
- Menu Bar & Shortcuts are implemented with the file, edit, and view drop-downs on the upper left side of the screen.
- The shortcuts are represented as "hotkeys" and have the ability to create a new week, task, event, save and open 
files, delete a task/event, or close the mini viewer. 

## Section 3: Power Ups
- Mini Viewer gives the user a way to open any single Event or Task in a new window. Display all details of the event/ 
task including its day of the week.
- Progress Bar shows a daily progress bar visualizing the number of tasks completed vs. planned for each day. Also 
includes a numeric count of the number of tasks remaining for each day. Both are displayed on the Week view.
